# DiffEC
This is a code repository in company with "Accelerating Electrochemical Parameter Estimation with Differentiable Simulations" currently under consideration. 

This repository features differentiable simulation of voltammetry covering diffusion, migration and convection, along with both Butler-Volmer and Marcus-Hush-Chidsey kinetics. In short, electrochemical simulations are made end-to-end differentiable for parameter estimation and optimization. 

The electrochemical simulations used Finite Difference (FD) methods, and made differentiable using JAX.
