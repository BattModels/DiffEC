This folder features running differentiable simulations with different initial guesses (ensemble methods) to estimate the kinetic and thermodynamic constants from experimental steady state currents. 
This programs are recommended to be run on a cluster with at least 400 GB of memory. 
The training results for all 50 trials are stored in the TrainingLog folder for future analysis. 
The simulation program is simulation.py. DiffCEMaster and DiffCEWorker are programs to help run iterative optimization.
