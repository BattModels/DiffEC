This folder features running differentiable simulations with different initial guesses (ensemble methods) to estimate the kinetic and thermodynamic constants from experimental steady state currents. 
This programs are recommended to be run on a cluster with at least 400 GB of memory 
The training results for all epochs are stored in the TrainingLog files for future analysis
