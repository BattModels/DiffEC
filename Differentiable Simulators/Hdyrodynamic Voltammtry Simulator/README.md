# Differentiable Simulation of Rotating Disk Electrode 


This simulator features voltammetry simulation on a rotating disk electrode by solving convection-diffusion equation. The simulator supporrts Butler-Volmer and Nernst boundary conditions. 

A schematic of a rotating disk electrode is shown below:
