# Differentiable Simulation of Rotating Disk Electrode 


This simulator features voltammetry simulation on a rotating disk electrode by solving convection-diffusion equation. The simulator supporrts Butler-Volmer and Nernst boundary conditions. 


Go to the Simulation.py file to run a few sample voltammograms at different rotational speed, scan rates, diffusion coefficient, and kinematic viscosity. Compare the results with the steady state current derived from Levich (which is 1).


A schematic of a rotating disk electrode is shown below:
